# ArchivesSpace AI Assistant

An experimental AI-powered reference assistant designed to help researchers navigate archival holdings described in ArchivesSpace.

Hosted by [USF Special Collections](https://lib.usf.edu/special-collections/), this tool allows users to submit natural language questions (e.g., "Do you have anything about labor unions in Tampa?") and receive intelligent, metadata-driven responses based on collection descriptions.

## Features

- Integrates with OpenAI‚Äôs GPT model via API
- Accepts user queries about archival topics
- Returns contextualized answers based on uploaded collection metadata
- Built using Flask (Python), HTML/JS frontend, and hosted with GitHub Pages + Replit

---

## Goals

- Improve access to archival materials through conversational interfaces
- Support undergraduate and graduate researchers unfamiliar with traditional finding aids
- Demonstrate scalable models for lightweight reference assistance using AI

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Static HTML/JavaScript (hosted on GitHub Pages)
- **Backend**: Flask API using OpenAI GPT model (currently deployed on Replit)
- **Optional Data Sources**: Exports from ArchivesSpace, JSON-formatted metadata

---

## Project Status

This is a prototype in active development. Future phases may include:

- Live integration with the ArchivesSpace API
- Multi-collection JSON ingestion
- Logging and feedback loop for staff review
- Secure deployment outside of Replit
